## My learning from this project

* Handlebars template engine with Node.js and Express
* Those layouts will contain the HTML structure, style sheets, and 
  scripts that are shared between templates.
* By default, the extension for Handlebars templates is .handlebars
  but we can change it
* To be able to reach the page, we need to configure a request handler
  like app.get..
* supplying data to handler templates from app.js
* using conditional logic and loops in handlebars template
* creater a helper function in app.js and calling same from handle bar
  template
